# OBJECTIVE
ALSA C++ wrappers for working with playback and capture devices on linux. I made this because I have wasted so many hours in trying to figure out how things work. So I decided to not let this goto waste and encapsulate all that I have known into three simple files:
i & ii) ALSADevices.cpp/ALSADevices.hpp
iii) constants.h

# Example:
For a very short example of how to use this wrapper with playback as well as with capture devices go and have a look at play_plain_audio.cpp

# REMEMBER TO USE HEADPHONES WHEN RUNNING THE EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT CAN FEEDBACK...

# CREDITS (HOW DID YOU EVEN DO THIS???)
Well thanks to this guy: https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6735?page=0,1
